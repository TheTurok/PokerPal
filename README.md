# PokerPal

PokerPal is an iOS and Android app designed to facilitate playing Poker games with you and
your friends! In essence, PokerPal simulates every aspect of a Poker game except for the cards.

Chip handling, pot calculation, pot splitting, etc. are all taken care of by the app.

Note that PokerPal is not a full Poker client! Our intention is that PokerPal gets
rid of the hassle of having chips around during a game of Poker, so that people
can concentrate on the more important things like winning $$ from their friends
and family!

PokerPal is currently in development by Airokay (Timothy C.) and Jalbatross(Joey A.).

# What are we working on right now?
At the moment, we are working on the client for the Android app!
